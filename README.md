IoT projects with Arduino
=========================

 - This project involves Jhonny-Five (the javascript framework for IoT) and Node.js to switch on a LED using a threshold value coming from a slider: [node-js-slider-led](./node-js-slider-led)
 - This project uses a couple of Arduino UNO boards with a Nordic nrf24l01+ transceiver each to send each other a radio message, the C++ code is managed by platformIO (a tool chain for Arduino boards): [nrf24l01-radio](./nrf24l01-radio)
